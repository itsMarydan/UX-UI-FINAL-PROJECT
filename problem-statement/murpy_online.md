## What is the problem? 

### Initial 

Murphy Online is designed to be a tool to help Students, Faculty and Staff navigate their basic needs while affiliated with St. Thomas. It is a core point of communication between with the university and its body. The challenge however is that the usage of murphy online is extremely complex and has an unreasnably high learning curve. It is not designed to be intuitive and does not follow conventions that help guide product usage. 

The university invests a lot of resources in supporting the paltform both  technical and usage support. Mulit-page instruction documentations have to be provided to first time users to guide them through finding basic tasks. Current users spend more time looking for desired (actions / tasks ) than they do fufiling those tasks. The navigation and grouping does not seem to organize ( functions / utilities ) in a meaningful way. This has rendered the platform undesireable and lacking from the perspective of its targeted users ( The St. Thomas Community). 

To succeed as a one stop for the community murphy online needs to be intentional about the vairous personas it caters to and provide naviation that is more intuitive to those personas. It should show relvant categories and groups that are based off convention and clear relationships. It should reduce the level of effort spent on accomplishing tasks by making them easier to find / navigate


### Refined 

The grouping and navigation issues with Murphy Online have significant business consequences for the St. Thomas community. The platform was designed to be a tool to help students, faculty, and staff navigate their basic needs while affiliated with the university, but its complexity and unintuitive design have rendered it less useful and less desirable. This has resulted in frustration and lost productivity for users who spend more time searching for desired actions or tasks than actually fulfilling them. Additionally, the university has invested significant resources in supporting the platform through technical and usage support, including providing multi-page instruction documents to guide first-time users. This has resulted in increased costs for the university and decreased satisfaction for users.

To address these issues, Murphy Online needs to take a user-centric approach to its design. This means that the platform should be redesigned to meet the needs and preferences of its various user personas. This could involve simplifying the navigation and grouping of functions, such as showing relevant categories and groups based on convention and clear relationships. Additionally, the platform should be designed to be more intuitive, following common design conventions that help guide product usage. By doing so, the platform will become easier to use, reducing the level of effort required to accomplish tasks and increasing user satisfaction.

Implementing these changes will result in several benefits for the St. Thomas community. Users will spend less time searching for tasks, making them more productive and allowing them to focus on their academic and professional responsibilities. The university will also save on costs associated with providing technical and usage support. Furthermore, a more user-friendly platform will increase satisfaction among students, faculty, and staff, improving the overall experience of the St. Thomas community. This will result in increased loyalty and retention, making Murphy Online a valuable tool for the university.
