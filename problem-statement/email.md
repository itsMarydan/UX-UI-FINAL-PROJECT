Subject: Help Us Improve Murphy Online: Take Our Survey Today!

Dear St. Thomas Community,

As part of our class project, we are studying Murphy Online, a critical communication channel between St. Thomas University and its students, faculty, and staff. Designed to be a comprehensive tool, Murphy Online is intended to streamline essential processes and serve as a one-stop-shop for the university community. However, we understand that the platform's unintuitive design and complex navigation have made it difficult for users to find and complete tasks efficiently, resulting in frustration and lost productivity.

To better understand the issues and make recommendations for improvements, we would like to invite you to take our survey. Your feedback is critical to our efforts, and by completing the survey, you will be providing valuable insights that will inform our report and recommendations.

Our recommendations may involve simplifying the navigation and grouping of functions, such as showing relevant categories and groups based on convention and clear relationships. Additionally, we may suggest that the platform be designed to be more intuitive, following common design conventions that help guide product usage. By doing so, the platform will become easier to use, reducing the level of effort required to accomplish tasks and increasing user satisfaction.

While we cannot guarantee that our recommendations will be implemented by the Murphy Online team, your feedback will be invaluable in helping us make meaningful recommendations for the improvement of the platform. Implementing these changes may result in several benefits for the St. Thomas community. Users may spend less time searching for tasks, making them more productive and allowing them to focus on their academic and professional responsibilities. The university may also save on costs associated with providing technical and usage support. Furthermore, a more user-friendly platform may increase satisfaction among students, faculty, and staff, improving the overall experience of the St. Thomas community.

If you are interested in sharing your thoughts in an interview, you can sign up for an interview via Zoom. We appreciate your time and willingness to help us understand the issues and make recommendations for improvements.
